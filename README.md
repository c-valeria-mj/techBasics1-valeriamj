# About me:
My name is Valeria, and I am originally from Guatemala, but I was raised in Mexico and lived most of my life in the Dominican Republic.
Now I live in Germany, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Media with a minor in Museum Studies.
My dream is to work for in a Museum! Perhaps not as a curator but in the Marketing department. 

# My favorite animal 
This is a Quokka. It's one of my favorite animals.
