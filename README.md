# About me:
My name is Valeria, and I am originally from Guatemala, but I was raised in Mexico and lived most of my life in the Dominican Republic.
Now I live in Germany, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Media with a minor in Museum Studies.
My dream is to work for in a Museum! Perhaps not as a curator but in the Marketing department. 

# A snapshot of LÃ¼neburg
Walking around the city and capturing small moments is one of my favorite activities.
This is a favorite from last year.
